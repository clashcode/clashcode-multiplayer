Jazz is a music genre that originated at the beginning of the 20th Century, 
arguably earlier, within the African-American communities of the Southern 
United States. Its roots lie in the combining by African-Americans of certain
European harmony and form elements, with their existing African-based music. 
Its African musical basis is evident in its use of blue notes, improvisation, 
polyrhythms, syncopation and the swung note. From its early development until
the present day, jazz has also incorporated elements from popular music 
especially, in its early days, from American popular music.

As the music has developed and spread around the world it has, since its early
American beginnings, drawn on many different national, regional and local 
musical cultures, giving rise to many distinctive styles: New Orleans jazz 
dating from the early 1910s, big band swing, Kansas City jazz and Gypsy 
jazz from the 1930s and 1940s, bebop from the mid-1940s on down through 
Afro-Cuban jazz, West Coast jazz, ska jazz, cool jazz, Indo jazz, avant-garde
jazz, soul jazz, modal jazz, chamber jazz, free jazz, Latin jazz in various 
forms, smooth jazz, jazz fusion and jazz rock, jazz funk, loft jazz, punk jazz, 
acid jazz, ethno jazz, jazz rap, cyber jazz, M-Base, nu jazz and other ways of
playing the music.

Talking of swing, Louis Armstrong, one of the most famous musicians in jazz, 
said to Bing Crosby on the latter's radio show, "Ah, swing, well, we used to 
call it syncopation, then they called it ragtime, then blues, then jazz. 
Now, it's swing. White folks - yo'all sho is a mess!"
